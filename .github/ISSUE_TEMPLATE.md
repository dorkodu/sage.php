Please do not post general questions directly as GitHub issues. They may sit for weeks unanswered, or may be spontaneously closed without answer.

## Reporting issues with Sage.php

Before filing a new issue, make sure an issue for your problem doesn't already exist.

The best way to get a bug fixed is to provide a _pull request_ with a simplified failing test case (or better yet, include a fix).

## Feature requests

Sage.php is a reference implementation of the [Sage proposal](https://github.com/dorkodu/sage). To discuss new features which are not Sage.php specific and fundamentally change the way Sage protocol works, open an issue against the proposal.

## Security bugs
